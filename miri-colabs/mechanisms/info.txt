Description: In order to provide all observing modes such as broad/narrow-band imaging, coronagraphy and low/medium resolution spectroscopy, the MIRI instrument is equipped with a filter wheel and two dichroic/grating wheel mechanisms. They allow for a re-configuration of the instrument between the different observing modes and wavelength ranges. The lower MIRI operating temperature of T ~ 7 K provided by a dedicated cooler, much lower than the passively cooled rest of JWST at a temperature of ~ 40 K, implying additional challenges. The main requirements for the three mechanisms with up to 18 positions on the filter wheel (see Fig. 1) include: reliable operation at T ~ 7 K, optical precision of < 4 arcsec, low power dissipation, vibration capability up to 13.5 Grms and full functionality in the temperature range 6 K < T < 300 K.
